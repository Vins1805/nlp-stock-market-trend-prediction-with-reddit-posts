WSB loves triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarcerate the flattening of the price action accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is AMC‚Äôs price action after the breakout. \\[Juicy is what juicy does\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc\\_looking\\_juicy\\_next\\_resistance\\_targets\\_1623/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)), what else can I say.\n",

Since the two stonks are short squeeze brothers in arms (...Dire Straits starts playing) and have been moving according to linear correlation for a considerable period of time, imho, it‚Äôs fair to assume that GME should catch its brother in arms up at some point in the near future, and this is the main assumption that I base my thesis on. \n",

       "So far so good, now take a look at those Fibo levels: the AMC retracement is applied from Jan apex (premarket 4h chart high, looks like a gap on daily) to the subsequent low during the local accumulation phase. Thereafter, the following extended Fibo levels are highlighted and are of the prior significance for the price action: 1.414, 2, 2.618, 3.272.

Just because we do our diligence and like the stock doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a fucking meme stock. I get that this is a Wendy‚Äôs, there are dumb asses, but dummies can make money too. I like the idea of buying/hold and averaging down here at this moment. It might not go back down too much at this point. \n",
       "\n",
       "RKT is up 20% over the past two weeks. There are a lot of retail investors that were ready to get out at 22 and a lot of swing traders just playing the gap fill. The thing is those shares have been getting brought up.\n",
       "\n",
       "The only reason the stock dropped as low as 16 is for two reasons: one, Gilbert transferred class D shares to class a shares for employee stock program at a 15% discount in order to increase the float and allow for more institutional ownership. This actually really helps the stock. Two, Growth funds sold the stock and now value funds are eating it up. This also includes a recent purchase from Swissbank. The stock is trading differently and shorts are having a lot harder time manipulating it due to the institutional accumulation in the Russell 1000 and additional value funds. You can check my previous DD‚Äôs for sources and more info. \n",
       "\n",
       "Right now the stock just filled the gap and hit a wall around 22.7. Institutions are letting retail buy and testing their patience. Reason why institutions do this is because they need to determine whether there are real investors or just impatient little children that cry if a stock doesn‚Äôt go up 50% in 1 hour. Once they see where we are buying they won‚Äôt allow people to accumulate very long at those levels. What happens next is called a retest at 22.7. Since Its already been doing some consolidation at those levels it will most likely break and when it does break it will go to 25. If 25 creates a lot of volume and attention there are about 45,000 contracts for June 18 at 25. 25 could be a huge wall of resistance but there could be a plan in place or this could just be a fake out before it actually takes off. \n",
       "\n",
       "I believe the floor 18.5 or 19.5 so I would look to accumulate at now, 19.5, and then load up at 18.8 with a stop loss of 16ish if you want. I believe they would initiate the buyback before it gets back below 17 simply because employees get the stock at a 15% discount and Dan transferred shares at 16.8ish so I would assume the stock stays 15% above this level. \n",
       "\n",
       "Now I wanna be very clear that this is not a fucking mortgage play. Right now that is what the market wants retail to believe. This is about a company I have previously worked for and I know firsthand that they achieve the goals set forth. They have yet to prove otherwise. Rocket homes is basically Zillow and their activity increased 300% in quarter one. Additionally rocket auto drops this August. I don‚Äôt know about you but I don‚Äôt get too thrilled going on to Carvana or Kelley blue book in order to find a car I talked to three different people before I actually get to the person that I want and then I have to find financing. Rockets mission is to make this as easy as possible so you can go onto a very clean website pick a car you want they will do the financing for you and then provide you with the vehicle. Won‚Äôt be surprised if they shipped the shit right to you eventually. Keep in mind that Detroit used to be the home of car manufacturing. Didnt Gilbert basically owns Detroit after buying up all the real estate after 2008 and has been rebuilding it since. It‚Äôs a totally different city now I have recently been there.\n",
       "\n",
       "One thing I really want to put emphasis on is the brand. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you started to see rocket homes commercials and a rocket auto commercials before September. They have also linked partnerships with golfers with big names and are using that for more marketing. As of right now they have not even started marketing these aspects but trust me it would be insane to think that they won‚Äôt make it work because if it‚Äôs one thing they know how to do it‚Äôs to market. Everyone wants the next big thing, you‚Äôll see commercials over and over again and eventually you‚Äôll actually see what rocket auto is about. When you see the platform you will hands-down choose it over any other bullshit website out there currently for cars. On top of that, they‚Äôll be the ones to provide you with the loan, they‚Äôll be the ones to profit off the sale. They don‚Äôt need a financing company like typical dealerships when you buy a car. They will fund it right to you. Competing with Zillow is a bit more of a challenge but I still think they will prevail.\n",
       "\n",
       "The company has a shitty PE ratio right now because it‚Äôs still being valued as just a mortgage company. Institutions however aren‚Äôt stupid and know this will change once the sectors start being marketed. You can see the price action right now is it institutional accumulation before they let retail pump it up.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you think that institutions would start buying a stock based off of mortgage credentials in a rising rate environment then I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôll ever be convinced. That is not what they‚Äôre doing. What I do know is that they probably believe that the amount of income they‚Äôll receive from their new revenue streams will certainly provide RKT the capital to obtain more market share in that field. Which is lucrative. \n",
       "\n",
       "Companies like Amazon wish they could get into mortgages. Except it‚Äôs very difficult field to just enter. No one knows anything about mortgages except for people who do it. Did you know that Lindsay gross gave a speech, He was Dan Gilbert‚Äôs roommate in college at law school. He actually expressed Amazon had an interest in mortgages, this is when the company was private. After looking over all of the financials and complications they decided they wouldn‚Äôt actually be able to be successful due to their business model. RKT got lucky and was at the right place at the right time. They merged technology with mortgages which is extremely profitable allowing for a constant stream of very high revenue, thus creating easier means to market additional revenue streams as they plan on doing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Position:  2600 shares @ 17.86 and 100 40.89s for 2023. I also have additional calls but I don‚Äôt really like giving that information out because I‚Äôm a little paranoid about hedge funds reading this shit.\n",
       "\n",
       "This is not advice I‚Äôm just stating the facts. If you‚Äôre looking to enter a position I believe the stock will test 25 and possibly all time highs in the next few months. I believe by 2023 it‚Äôll be over 150 a share. I would buying share until iv dies down on options.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another thing I want to mention is that leaps are crazy expensive right now. I wonder why. \n",
       "\n",
       "TLDR: rocket auto and rocket homes are soon going to be a very well-known products and institutions are starting to accumulate and take notice. This is not a mortgage play this is a value play. Don‚Äôt ever listen to any articles to justify price action that‚Äôs for the sheep. It just makes sense. All you have to do is accumulate for the next two weeks and I think you‚Äôll just see green moving forward. Below $20 a share won‚Äôt be seen after September ever again imo.\n",

       "Edit 2: if you want to invest in a mortgage company then sure invest in both RKT and Uwm. If you want to invest in a mortgage and soon to be tech giant with massive growth and 194th richest company on Fortune 500 then invest in RKT. Idk about you but mortgages are boring. I like innovation. I like a company that‚Äôs ranked the fifth best place to work in the entire country. I like the company that is ranked the number one largest mortgage lender for over 10 years by JD powers. The best part is, it took three decades to get to this point so any competitor is going to have to play 30 years of catch-up at Rockets pace and trust me nobody works more than the people at RKT. 60 hours a week is a norm but execution is worshipped.\n",

       "now i wanna be very clear that this is not a fucking mortgage play right now that is what the market wants retail to believe this is about a company i have previously worked for and i know firsthand that they achieve the goals set forth they have yet to prove otherwise rocket homes is basically zillow and their activity increased in quarter one additionally rocket auto drops this august i dont know about you but i dont get too thrilled going on to carvana or kelley blue book in order to find a car i talked to three different people before i actually get to the person that i want and then i have to find financing rockets mission is to make this as easy as possible so you can go onto a very clean website pick a car you want they will do the financing for you and then provide you with the vehicle wont be surprised if they shipped the shit right to you eventually keep in mind that detroit used to be the home of car manufacturing didnt gilbert basically owns detroit after buying up all the real estate after and has been rebuilding it since its a totally different city now i have recently been there one thing i really want to put emphasis on is the brand i wouldnt be surprised if you started to see rocket homes commercials and a rocket auto commercials before september they have also linked partnerships with golfers with big names and are using that for more marketing as of right now they have not even started marketing these aspects but trust me it would be insane to think that they wont make it work because if its one thing they know how to do its to market everyone wants the next big thing youll see commercials over and over again and eventually youll actually see what rocket auto is about when you see the platform you will handsdown choose it over any other bullshit website out there currently for cars on top of that theyll be the ones to provide you with the loan theyll be the ones to profit off the sale they dont need a financing company like typical dealerships when you buy a car they will fund it right to you competing with zillow is a bit more of a challenge but i still think they will prevail the company has a shitty pe ratio right now because its still being valued as just a mortgage company institutions however arent stupid and know this will change once the sectors start being marketed you can see the price action right now is it institutional accumulation before they let retail pump it up if you think that institutions would start buying a stock based off of mortgage credentials in a rising rate environment then i dont know how youll ever be convinced that is not what theyre doing what i do know is that they probably believe that the amount of income theyll receive from their new revenue streams will certainly provide rkt the capital to obtain more market share in that field which is lucrative \n",
       "companies like amazon wish they could get into mortgages except its very difficult field to just enter no one knows anything about mortgages except for people who do it did you know that lindsay gross gave a speech he was dan gilberts roommate in college at law school he actually expressed amazon had an interest in mortgages this is when the company was private after looking over all of the financials and complications they decided they wouldnt actually be able to be successful due to their business model rkt got lucky and was at the right place at the right time they merged technology with mortgages which is extremely profitable allowing for a constant stream of very high revenue thus creating easier means to market additional revenue streams as they plan on doing position  shares  and  for i also have additional calls but i dont really like giving that information out because im a little paranoid about hedge funds reading this shit this is not advice im just stating the facts if youre looking to enter a position i believe the stock will test and possibly all time highs in the next few months i believe by itll be over a share i would buying share until iv dies down on options another thing i want to mention is that leaps are crazy expensive right now i wonder why \n",
       "tldr rocket auto and rocket homes are soon going to be a very wellknown products and institutions are starting to accumulate and take notice this is not a mortgage play this is a value play dont ever listen to any articles to justify price action thats for the sheep it just makes sense all you have to do is accumulate for the next two weeks and i think youll just see green moving forward below a share wont be seen after september ever again imo edit typos edit if you want to invest in a mortgage company then sure invest in both rkt and uwm if you want to invest in a mortgage and soon to be tech giant with massive growth and richest company on fortune then invest in rkt idk about you but mortgages are boring i like innovation i like a company thats ranked the fifth best place to work in the entire country i like the company that is ranked the number one largest mortgage lender for over years by jd powers the best part is it took three decades to get to this point so any competitor is going to have to play years of catchup at rockets pace and trust me nobody works more than the people at rkt hours a week is a norm but execution is worshipped edit took out the yolo opinion forgot my audience for a second</td>\n",

       "* **Excellent fundamentals**: AND improving on top of it. Your YOLOs don't have to be a retarded microcap company with insane debt, negative earnings, and priced on hope. ASO has an industry leading net profit margin on top of decreasing liabilities YoY, increasing equities YoY, and increasing Income YoY. All possible fundamental analysis metrics points out that ASO's financials are spectacular.\n",

       "* **Low implied volatility of only 67%**: Theta gang hates this simple trick! bUt WhAt D0eS iT MeaN? Retard, it means you pay less for your FDs and can load up your account and your wife's boyfriend's account on more OTM long calls. You will also benefit with volatility expansions if shorts are forced to cover their asses (remember, it's at fucking 30%).\n",
       "* **Slays every earning estimates for the past year**: it fucking destroyed last earnings estimate consensus by over 100% and **DOUBLED** it's guidance for this year. It's price reaction on earnings date? +3%.\n",
       "* **Literally all independent analysts are bullish**: unlike the retarded stocks priced on hope of change.\n",
       "* **On WSB's radar for some time already**: Unfortunately being drowned out by shit ass tickers with humongous debt, shit earnings, and ridiculous valuations.\n",
       "* **Your wife's boyfriend most likely shops there:** While you shop for funko pops at gamestop with your good boy points, all the real chads are shopping at Academy Sports. Guns, ammo, athletic clothing, bikes, fishing gear, sport stuff, you name it- they're all in high demand. Fathers day is also on June 20th, so be sure to get your wife's baby's daddy something nice.\n",

Its products include Eversense and Eversense XL, which are implantable CGM systems to measure glucose levels in people with diabetes for a period of up to 90 and 180 days. The Eversense (90 days) has FDA approval since 2018 and the Eversense XL (180 days) is already approved in Europe and FDA approval is expected by the end of the third quarter. A CGM system provides glucose measurements regularly and gives the user an alarm when sugar levels drop too low or go too high, it can also be used in connection with an insulin pump to automatically deliver insulin when needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Eversense technology is unique as it is a long-term CGM system that can last up to 180 days, versus 7 to 14 days from the competition, and it is the only one implantable under the skin and works with a removable transmitter (in competing products you cannot remove the transmitter; otherwise, you have to replace the whole device). It is a CGM system that allows for freedom of movement and the user can decide when to use it and all this with even better accuracy than all other CGM systems in the market.\n",
       "\n",
       "The almost demise of Senseonics in 2020 was due to some self inflicted errors and bad luck. The company tried to commercialize Eversense on its own in the USA and that consumed much of its economic resources without much success and then, when COVID hit, the company stopped commercializing Eversense as it couldn't get physicians to perform the sensor implant procedure. In March 2020, Senseonics was forced to make a $48.5 MM repayment to one of its lenders that panicked and that pushed the company into the limits of insolvency and forced it to look for a partner or outright sale.\n",
       "\n",
       "Enter Ascensia Diabetes\n",
       "\n",
       "On August 10th, 2020, the company announced a strategic collaboration with Ascensia Diabetes Care. This is a transformational alliance for Senseonics, as Ascensia is a dedicated diabetes company with a presence in 125 countries and 10 MM customers. It has the trust and reliability of being in this business for over 70 years. Ascensia is the market leader in the Blood Glucose Monitoring (BGM) market with its COUNTOUR portfolio of devices and it is the combination of several important companies with interests in the Diabetes market. Ascensia is based in Switzerland and it was established in 2016 through the acquisition of Bayer Diabetes Care by PHC Holdings (formerly known as Panasonic Healthcare Holdings), which is a KKR portfolio company.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ascensia Diabetes Care is betting big on Senseonics. Not only are they providing 35 MM in convertible debt financing but will also invest an approximate $250 MM over the next five years to commercialize and market Eversense in exclusivity all over the world. So why would such a company with approximately $1 Billion in annual sales is interested in a $4 MM revenue company?\n",
       "\n",
       "I believe Ascensia recognizes the enormous potential of this technology, which could eventually make redundant even their current business. Ascensia business is CONTOUR, a razor/razor blade business model in which the company sells blood glucose measuring devices for a low price and makes money selling the small lancets that are replaceable. Make a tour through Amazon or simply Google \"Blood glucose monitoring\" and you will find that this market is over saturated with dozens of suppliers competing in price. Ascensia prices its wares at a premium over competitors but the technology is mature so I am not so sure if new diabetes clients will be choosing Contour going forward. Basically, they need a new product that can reinvigorate the brand and put them once again at the leading edge of the diabetes market.\n",
       "\n",
       "Currently the Senseonics Eversense device requires calibration twice a day, that could be done using a Contour device to measure the glucose level and input the result in the Eversense device via an iPhone or Android Phone. But as the following slide shows, the company has a product pipeline with next generation devices that will require increasingly less calibration. The Eversense XL submitted for approval to the FDA requires only one calibration a day and the Eversense 365 will require only one rebalancing a week reducing considerably the use of lancets for blood monitoring systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "The technology has huge potential to disrupt the current CGM market, which is a $5-plus billion market today growing at about a 35% CAGR (according to SENS management) and dominated by three large companies: DexCom (DXCM), Abbott Labs (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT). This market is exclusively focused on the Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients which are intensively managed, that means they need insulin shots and many even use insulin pumps as they cannot produce any insulin themselves. The number of people with diagnosed diabetes in the USA in 2020 was 34.2 of which 1.6 MM have Type I Diabetes, unfortunately the number of people with Diabetes is growing very rapidly as can be seen from this National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2020.\n",
       "\n",
       "With FDA approval for the Eversense XL expected by the end of the third quarter, Senseonics will start to eat at the market share of the incumbent companies in the industry, but the real game changer will come with the Eversense 365, as it will open up the Type II market to this new type of CGM devices. Here the opportunity is really huge and they face no competition and none is expected anytime soon either.\n",
       "\n",
       "Currently, people with Type II diabetes have only BGM devices like CONTOUR to help them monitor their blood levels, but that requires pricking a finger to get blood and only provides a measurement at that particular moment. The 365 device will require only a 5 minute intervention every year to remove and replace the sensor and if the company gets to the point that won't need a transmitter, as you scan your smartphone over the sensor, then I believe the sky is the limit for Senseonics as there are 420 MM people with diabetes in the world.\n",
       "\n",
       "The company is providing the current guidance as to future revenues, I believe these numbers to be conservative once the Eversense XL gets approval in the USA. I am confident it will be approved, it has already been approved in Europe and the 90 days device was unanimously approved in 2018 by the FDA's Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices Panel of independent medical experts that voted, 8 to 0, that the system not only was safe and effective, but also that its benefits outweighed the risks.\n",
       "\n",
       "Senseonics is a high risk/high reward type of investment, but the type of risk I like, basically there is a small chance that the company will file for insolvency anytime soon and with the Ascencia alliance it stands a very good shot at disrupting the diabetes market. In my opinion, Senseonics has the makings of a potential multi-bagger from here and aggressive investors would be advised to initiate a position at the current levels. Next catalysts for the company will be information of progress in the commercialization in Europe and from April 1st in the USA, then it will be the Eversense XL approval by the end of September.</td>\n",

       "Company Overview\n",
       "\n",
       "**Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ:** [**CLNE**](https://utradea.com/stocks/CLNE)) provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and relating fueling solutions primarily in the United States and Canada. The company supplies renewable natural gas (RNG), compressed natural gas (CNG), and liquified natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. They serve heavy-duty trucking, airports, public transit, industrial, and institutional energy users as well as government fleets. With over 20 years in the alternative fuels industry, they are one of the largest (if not largest) U.S providers of FNG for commercial transportation and have a unique position in the market because of their valuable Environmental Credits.\n",
       "\n",
       "RNG which is delivered as either CNG or LNG is created by the recovery and processing of naturally occurring, environmentally detrimental waste methane from non-fossil fuel sources such as dairy farms and agriculture facilities. Methane is one of the most potent climate-harming greenhouse gases with a big impact on global warming, 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. They are focused on developing, owning, and operating dairy and other livestock waste RNG projects and supplying RNG to their customers in the commercial transportation sector.\n",
       "\n",
       "2020 Financial Results\n",
       "\n",
       "**Revenue:** CLNE‚Äôs 2020 total revenue was $209.2M which had a YoY change from 2019 of -15.2% or a decrease of $52.3M. This decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related sales but partially offset by customer contracts with their Zero Now truck financing program and an increase in station construction sales. Of the total revenue in 2020, 84.1% was from volume-related revenue mostly from fuel sales and the performance of O&amp;M services. Despite 2020‚Äôs bad financial performance attributable to economic conditions, we also saw similar companies in the industry posting decreased revenues. CLNE is positioned for high revenues with the upcoming ventures and new developments that will allow the company to expand and meet the growing demand in the transportation sector.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Expenses:** Total cost of sales accounted for 63.5% of total revenue; 55.4% from product cost of sales and 8.1% from service cost of sales. The total cost of sales decreased by 12.6% or $26.7M YoY primarily due to decreased gallons delivered during 2020 and their lower effective cost per gallon. The total operating expenses also decreased but attributable to decreased revenues. In the prior year (2018 to 2019), we saw decreased operating expenses and increased operating margin which was due to cost reduction efforts. Going forward if CLNE is able to continue decreasing their operating expenses and keep at a positive operating margin then they‚Äôll be able to post a profitable period in the upcoming years that‚Äôll help with seeing shareholder returns.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Debt:** CLNE has a short-term debt of $3.59M and long-term debt of $82.09M of totalling $85.68M making up 44.6% of their total liabilities. They have a debt ratio of 0.27 which is relatively low compared to the competitors identified that have an average of 0.68; representing CLNE‚Äôs lower debt to assets. Despite the capital-intensive industry CLNE is operating in, their lower ratio is primarily attributed to their high cash position. The lower ratio also gives insight into the company‚Äôs ability to pay off their future debts and their lower risk for bankruptcy (\n",
       "\n",
       "Recent Developments\n",
       "\n",
       "**Amazon:** It was announced in April this year that CLNE signed an agreement with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon RNG. The fuel will be provided at 27 existing CLNE fuelling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations that expects to be constructed by the end of the year. This agreement was announced after Amazon‚Äôs action earlier this year to reduce the carbon footprint of their delivery fleets.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Bp Joint Venture:** A joint venture was finalized in March this year with BP Products North America Inc. to develop, own and operate new RNG projects at dairies and other agriculture facilities. This joint venture is valued at upwards of $400M with BP investing a total of $50M. ¬†This joint venture will help to RNG production and meet the growing demand.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Chevron Adopt-a-Port:** Chevron U.S.A a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron Corp is investing a total of $28M into this initiative that focuses on providing truck operators near ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach with cleaner, carbon-negative RNG in order to reduce GHG emissions. Chevron‚Äôs funding will allow truck operators to subsidize the cost of buying new or converting RNG-powered trucks.\n",
       "\n",
       "Investment Thesis: Growing Demand for RNG\n",
       "\n",
       "The demand for RNG produced from biogas is significantly growing due to federal, state and local regulatory authorities on reducing the emission of GHG such as methane. Over the past decade, the transportation sector has been the fastest-growing end-market for RNG where it‚Äôs used as a replacement for fossil-based fuel. This growth is mainly driven by an increased focus on reducing GHGs across America and worldwide. With any car, truck, bus, or any other vehicle capable of being manufactured to run on RNG, the shift to RNG is imminent. In the U.S, renewable energy growth is expected to accelerate in 2021 and forward as the Biden administration starts to execute many initiatives including:\n",
       "\n",
       "* Rejoining the Paris Climate Accord\n",
       "* Investing $2T into clean energy over the next 4 years\n",
       "* Fully decarbonizing the power sector by 2035 in order to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050\n",
       "\n",
       "Renewable natural gas production has already more than doubled from 2015 to 2018 growing by an annual average of 30%. If the industry continues to grow at this rate of growth, we can expect that the industry would reach 1B gallons of the annual production of RNG transportation fuel in 2022.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Final Thoughts**\n",
       "\n",
       "With CLNE being the biggest producer of RNG in the U.S and the increased demand for RNG set to accelerate as stricter restrictions come into place, we will see a shift in the transportation industry into cleaner fuel sources. The company is well-positioned in the RNG industry to continue being a leading provider and deliver attractive returns for shareholders in the future to come. Going forward, I hope to see more news on developments with bigger corporations looking to hop on the RNG wave. I think it is only soon until cities regulate the use of RNG in more commercial use transport like public transport and we see the shift to decarbonized transport\n",

Triangles incarcerate the flattening of the price action accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is AMC‚Äôs price action after the breakout. \\[Juicy is what juicy does\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc\\_looking\\_juicy\\_next\\_resistance\\_targets\\_1623/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)), what else can I say.\n",

       "\n",
       "All these ‚Äúmeme stocks‚Äù are posted when the stock is already up 50%. This one of those get in before that happens. I don‚Äôt think RKT is a meme stock to be honest‚Ä¶and fuck that term. Just because we do our diligence and like the stock doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a fucking meme stock. I get that this is a Wendy‚Äôs, there are dumb asses, but dummies can make money too. I like the idea of buying/hold and averaging down here at this moment. It might not go back down too much at this point. \n",
       "\n",
       "RKT is up 20% over the past two weeks. There are a lot of retail investors that were ready to get out at 22 and a lot of swing traders just playing the gap fill. The thing is those shares have been getting brought up.\n",
       "\n",
       "The only reason the stock dropped as low as 16 is for two reasons: one, Gilbert transferred class D shares to class a shares for employee stock program at a 15% discount in order to increase the float and allow for more institutional ownership. This actually really helps the stock. Two, Growth funds sold the stock and now value funds are eating it up. This also includes a recent purchase from Swissbank. The stock is trading differently and shorts are having a lot harder time manipulating it due to the institutional accumulation in the Russell 1000 and additional value funds. You can check my previous DD‚Äôs for sources and more info. \n",
       "\n",
       "Right now the stock just filled the gap and hit a wall around 22.7. Institutions are letting retail buy and testing their patience. Reason why institutions do this is because they need to determine whether there are real investors or just impatient little children that cry if a stock doesn‚Äôt go up 50% in 1 hour. Once they see where we are buying they won‚Äôt allow people to accumulate very long at those levels. What happens next is called a retest at 22.7. Since Its already been doing some consolidation at those levels it will most likely break and when it does break it will go to 25. If 25 creates a lot of volume and attention there are about 45,000 contracts for June 18 at 25. 25 could be a huge wall of resistance but there could be a plan in place or this could just be a fake out before it actually takes off. \n",
       "\n",
       "I believe the floor 18.5 or 19.5 so I would look to accumulate at now, 19.5, and then load up at 18.8 with a stop loss of 16ish if you want. I believe they would initiate the buyback before it gets back below 17 simply because employees get the stock at a 15% discount and Dan transferred shares at 16.8ish so I would assume the stock stays 15% above this level. \n",
       "\n",
       "Now I wanna be very clear that this is not a fucking mortgage play. Right now that is what the market wants retail to believe. This is about a company I have previously worked for and I know firsthand that they achieve the goals set forth. They have yet to prove otherwise. Rocket homes is basically Zillow and their activity increased 300% in quarter one. Additionally rocket auto drops this August. I don‚Äôt know about you but I don‚Äôt get too thrilled going on to Carvana or Kelley blue book in order to find a car I talked to three different people before I actually get to the person that I want and then I have to find financing. Rockets mission is to make this as easy as possible so you can go onto a very clean website pick a car you want they will do the financing for you and then provide you with the vehicle. Won‚Äôt be surprised if they shipped the shit right to you eventually. Keep in mind that Detroit used to be the home of car manufacturing. Didnt Gilbert basically owns Detroit after buying up all the real estate after 2008 and has been rebuilding it since. It‚Äôs a totally different city now I have recently been there.\n",
       "\n",
       "One thing I really want to put emphasis on is the brand. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you started to see rocket homes commercials and a rocket auto commercials before September. They have also linked partnerships with golfers with big names and are using that for more marketing. As of right now they have not even started marketing these aspects but trust me it would be insane to think that they won‚Äôt make it work because if it‚Äôs one thing they know how to do it‚Äôs to market. Everyone wants the next big thing, you‚Äôll see commercials over and over again and eventually you‚Äôll actually see what rocket auto is about. When you see the platform you will hands-down choose it over any other bullshit website out there currently for cars. On top of that, they‚Äôll be the ones to provide you with the loan, they‚Äôll be the ones to profit off the sale. They don‚Äôt need a financing company like typical dealerships when you buy a car. They will fund it right to you. Competing with Zillow is a bit more of a challenge but I still think they will prevail.\n",
       "\n",
       "The company has a shitty PE ratio right now because it‚Äôs still being valued as just a mortgage company. Institutions however aren‚Äôt stupid and know this will change once the sectors start being marketed. You can see the price action right now is it institutional accumulation before they let retail pump it up.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you think that institutions would start buying a stock based off of mortgage credentials in a rising rate environment then I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôll ever be convinced. That is not what they‚Äôre doing. What I do know is that they probably believe that the amount of income they‚Äôll receive from their new revenue streams will certainly provide RKT the capital to obtain more market share in that field. Which is lucrative. \n",

After looking over all of the financials and complications they decided they wouldn‚Äôt actually be able to be successful due to their business model.

I like innovation. I like a company that‚Äôs ranked the fifth best place to work in the entire country. I like the company that is ranked the number one largest mortgage lender for over 10 years by JD powers. The best part is, it took three decades to get to this point so any competitor is going to have to play 30 years of catch-up at Rockets pace and trust me nobody works more than the people at RKT. 60 hours a week is a norm but execution is worshipped.\n",

       "rkt is up over the past two weeks there are a lot of retail investors that were ready to get out at and a lot of swing traders just playing the gap fill the thing is those shares have been getting brought up the only reason the stock dropped as low as is for two reasons one gilbert transferred class d shares to class a shares for employee stock program at a discount in order to increase the float and allow for more institutional ownership this actually really helps the stock two growth funds sold the stock and now value funds are eating it up this also includes a recent purchase from swissbank the stock is trading differently and shorts are having a lot harder time manipulating it due to the institutional accumulation in the russell and additional value funds you can check my previous dds for sources and more info \n",
       "right now the stock just filled the gap and hit a wall around institutions are letting retail buy and testing their patience reason why institutions do this is because they need to determine whether there are real investors or just impatient little children that cry if a stock doesnt go up in hour once they see where we are buying they wont allow people to accumulate very long at those levels what happens next is called a retest at since its already been doing some consolidation at those levels it will most likely break and when it does break it will go to if creates a lot of volume and attention there are about contracts for june at  could be a huge wall of resistance but there could be a plan in place or this could just be a fake out before it actually takes off \n",

       "* **Literally all independent analysts are bullish**: unlike the retarded stocks priced on hope of change.\n",
       "* **On WSB's radar for some time already**: Unfortunately being drowned out by shit ass tickers with humongous debt, shit earnings, and ridiculous valuations.\n",
       "* **Your wife's boyfriend most likely shops there:** While you shop for funko pops at gamestop with your good boy points, all the real chads are shopping at Academy Sports.

Its products include Eversense and Eversense XL, which are implantable CGM systems to measure glucose levels in people with diabetes for a period of up to 90 and 180 days. The Eversense (90 days) has FDA approval since 2018 and the Eversense XL (180 days) is already approved in Europe and FDA approval is expected by the end of the third quarter. A CGM system provides glucose measurements regularly and gives the user an alarm when sugar levels drop too low or go too high, it can also be used in connection with an insulin pump to automatically deliver insulin when needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Eversense technology is unique as it is a long-term CGM system that can last up to 180 days, versus 7 to 14 days from the competition, and it is the only one implantable under the skin and works with a removable transmitter (in competing products you cannot remove the transmitter; otherwise, you have to replace the whole device). It is a CGM system that allows for freedom of movement and the user can decide when to use it and all this with even better accuracy than all other CGM systems in the market.\n",
       "\n",
       "The almost demise of Senseonics in 2020 was due to some self inflicted errors and bad luck. The company tried to commercialize Eversense on its own in the USA and that consumed much of its economic resources without much success and then, when COVID hit, the company stopped commercializing Eversense as it couldn't get physicians to perform the sensor implant procedure. In March 2020, Senseonics was forced to make a $48.5 MM repayment to one of its lenders that panicked and that pushed the company into the limits of insolvency and forced it to look for a partner or outright sale.\n",
       "\n",
       "Enter Ascensia Diabetes\n",
       "\n",
       "On August 10th, 2020, the company announced a strategic collaboration with Ascensia Diabetes Care. This is a transformational alliance for Senseonics, as Ascensia is a dedicated diabetes company with a presence in 125 countries and 10 MM customers. It has the trust and reliability of being in this business for over 70 years. Ascensia is the market leader in the Blood Glucose Monitoring (BGM) market with its COUNTOUR portfolio of devices and it is the combination of several important companies with interests in the Diabetes market. Ascensia is based in Switzerland and it was established in 2016 through the acquisition of Bayer Diabetes Care by PHC Holdings (formerly known as Panasonic Healthcare Holdings), which is a KKR portfolio company.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ascensia Diabetes Care is betting big on Senseonics. Not only are they providing 35 MM in convertible debt financing but will also invest an approximate $250 MM over the next five years to commercialize and market Eversense in exclusivity all over the world. So why would such a company with approximately $1 Billion in annual sales is interested in a $4 MM revenue company?\n",
       "\n",
       "I believe Ascensia recognizes the enormous potential of this technology, which could eventually make redundant even their current business. Ascensia business is CONTOUR, a razor/razor blade business model in which the company sells blood glucose measuring devices for a low price and makes money selling the small lancets that are replaceable. Make a tour through Amazon or simply Google \"Blood glucose monitoring\" and you will find that this market is over saturated with dozens of suppliers competing in price. Ascensia prices its wares at a premium over competitors but the technology is mature so I am not so sure if new diabetes clients will be choosing Contour going forward. Basically, they need a new product that can reinvigorate the brand and put them once again at the leading edge of the diabetes market.\n",
       "\n",
       "Currently the Senseonics Eversense device requires calibration twice a day, that could be done using a Contour device to measure the glucose level and input the result in the Eversense device via an iPhone or Android Phone. But as the following slide shows, the company has a product pipeline with next generation devices that will require increasingly less calibration. The Eversense XL submitted for approval to the FDA requires only one calibration a day and the Eversense 365 will require only one rebalancing a week reducing considerably the use of lancets for blood monitoring systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "The technology has huge potential to disrupt the current CGM market, which is a $5-plus billion market today growing at about a 35% CAGR (according to SENS management) and dominated by three large companies: DexCom (DXCM), Abbott Labs (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT). This market is exclusively focused on the Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients which are intensively managed, that means they need insulin shots and many even use insulin pumps as they cannot produce any insulin themselves. The number of people with diagnosed diabetes in the USA in 2020 was 34.2 of which 1.6 MM have Type I Diabetes, unfortunately the number of people with Diabetes is growing very rapidly as can be seen from this National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2020.\n",
       "\n",
       "With FDA approval for the Eversense XL expected by the end of the third quarter, Senseonics will start to eat at the market share of the incumbent companies in the industry, but the real game changer will come with the Eversense 365, as it will open up the Type II market to this new type of CGM devices. Here the opportunity is really huge and they face no competition and none is expected anytime soon either.\n",
       "\n",
       "Currently, people with Type II diabetes have only BGM devices like CONTOUR to help them monitor their blood levels, but that requires pricking a finger to get blood and only provides a measurement at that particular moment. The 365 device will require only a 5 minute intervention every year to remove and replace the sensor and if the company gets to the point that won't need a transmitter, as you scan your smartphone over the sensor, then I believe the sky is the limit for Senseonics as there are 420 MM people with diabetes in the world.\n",
       "\n",
       "The company is providing the current guidance as to future revenues, I believe these numbers to be conservative once the Eversense XL gets approval in the USA. I am confident it will be approved, it has already been approved in Europe and the 90 days device was unanimously approved in 2018 by the FDA's Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices Panel of independent medical experts that voted, 8 to 0, that the system not only was safe and effective, but also that its benefits outweighed the risks.\n",
       "\n",
       "Senseonics is a high risk/high reward type of investment, but the type of risk I like, basically there is a small chance that the company will file for insolvency anytime soon and with the Ascencia alliance it stands a very good shot at disrupting the diabetes market. In my opinion, Senseonics has the makings of a potential multi-bagger from here and aggressive investors would be advised to initiate a position at the current levels. Next catalysts for the company will be information of progress in the commercialization in Europe and from April 1st in the USA, then it will be the Eversense XL approval by the end of September.</td>\n",

       "with fda approval for the eversense xl expected by the end of the third quarter senseonics will start to eat at the market share of the incumbent companies in the industry but the real game changer will come with the eversense as it will open up the type ii market to this new type of cgm devices here the opportunity is really huge and they face no competition and none is expected anytime soon either currently people with type ii diabetes have only bgm devices like contour to help them monitor their blood levels but that requires pricking a finger to get blood and only provides a measurement at that particular moment the device will require only a minute intervention every year to remove and replace the sensor and if the company gets to the point that wont need a transmitter as you scan your smartphone over the sensor then i believe the sky is the limit for senseonics as there are mm people with diabetes in the world the company is providing the current guidance as to future revenues i believe these numbers to be conservative once the eversense xl gets approval in the usa i am confident it will be approved it has already been approved in europe and the days device was unanimously approved in by the fdas clinical chemistry and clinical toxicology devices panel of independent medical experts that voted to that the system not only was safe and effective but also that its benefits outweighed the risks senseonics is a high riskhigh reward type of investment but the type of risk i like basically there is a small chance that the company will file for insolvency anytime soon and with the ascencia alliance it stands a very good shot at disrupting the diabetes market in my opinion senseonics has the makings of a potential multibagger from here and aggressive investors would be advised to initiate a position at the current levels next catalysts for the company will be information of progress in the commercialization in europe and from april in the usa then it will be the eversense xl approval by the end of september</td>\n",

       "Company Overview\n",
       "\n",
       "**Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ:** [**CLNE**](https://utradea.com/stocks/CLNE)) provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and relating fueling solutions primarily in the United States and Canada. The company supplies renewable natural gas (RNG), compressed natural gas (CNG), and liquified natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. They serve heavy-duty trucking, airports, public transit, industrial, and institutional energy users as well as government fleets. With over 20 years in the alternative fuels industry, they are one of the largest (if not largest) U.S providers of FNG for commercial transportation and have a unique position in the market because of their valuable Environmental Credits.\n",
       "\n",
       "RNG which is delivered as either CNG or LNG is created by the recovery and processing of naturally occurring, environmentally detrimental waste methane from non-fossil fuel sources such as dairy farms and agriculture facilities. Methane is one of the most potent climate-harming greenhouse gases with a big impact on global warming, 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. They are focused on developing, owning, and operating dairy and other livestock waste RNG projects and supplying RNG to their customers in the commercial transportation sector.\n",
       "\n",
       "2020 Financial Results\n",
       "\n",
       "**Revenue:** CLNE‚Äôs 2020 total revenue was $209.2M which had a YoY change from 2019 of -15.2% or a decrease of $52.3M. This decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related sales but partially offset by customer contracts with their Zero Now truck financing program and an increase in station construction sales. Of the total revenue in 2020, 84.1% was from volume-related revenue mostly from fuel sales and the performance of O&amp;M services. Despite 2020‚Äôs bad financial performance attributable to economic conditions, we also saw similar companies in the industry posting decreased revenues. CLNE is positioned for high revenues with the upcoming ventures and new developments that will allow the company to expand and meet the growing demand in the transportation sector.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Expenses:** Total cost of sales accounted for 63.5% of total revenue; 55.4% from product cost of sales and 8.1% from service cost of sales. The total cost of sales decreased by 12.6% or $26.7M YoY primarily due to decreased gallons delivered during 2020 and their lower effective cost per gallon. The total operating expenses also decreased but attributable to decreased revenues. In the prior year (2018 to 2019), we saw decreased operating expenses and increased operating margin which was due to cost reduction efforts. Going forward if CLNE is able to continue decreasing their operating expenses and keep at a positive operating margin then they‚Äôll be able to post a profitable period in the upcoming years that‚Äôll help with seeing shareholder returns.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Debt:** CLNE has a short-term debt of $3.59M and long-term debt of $82.09M of totalling $85.68M making up 44.6% of their total liabilities. They have a debt ratio of 0.27 which is relatively low compared to the competitors identified that have an average of 0.68; representing CLNE‚Äôs lower debt to assets. Despite the capital-intensive industry CLNE is operating in, their lower ratio is primarily attributed to their high cash position. The lower ratio also gives insight into the company‚Äôs ability to pay off their future debts and their lower risk for bankruptcy (\n",
       "\n",
       "Recent Developments\n",
       "\n",
       "**Amazon:** It was announced in April this year that CLNE signed an agreement with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon RNG. The fuel will be provided at 27 existing CLNE fuelling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations that expects to be constructed by the end of the year. This agreement was announced after Amazon‚Äôs action earlier this year to reduce the carbon footprint of their delivery fleets.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Bp Joint Venture:** A joint venture was finalized in March this year with BP Products North America Inc. to develop, own and operate new RNG projects at dairies and other agriculture facilities. This joint venture is valued at upwards of $400M with BP investing a total of $50M. ¬†This joint venture will help to RNG production and meet the growing demand.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Chevron Adopt-a-Port:** Chevron U.S.A a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron Corp is investing a total of $28M into this initiative that focuses on providing truck operators near ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach with cleaner, carbon-negative RNG in order to reduce GHG emissions. Chevron‚Äôs funding will allow truck operators to subsidize the cost of buying new or converting RNG-powered trucks.\n",
       "\n",
       "Investment Thesis: Growing Demand for RNG\n",
       "\n",
       "The demand for RNG produced from biogas is significantly growing due to federal, state and local regulatory authorities on reducing the emission of GHG such as methane. Over the past decade, the transportation sector has been the fastest-growing end-market for RNG where it‚Äôs used as a replacement for fossil-based fuel. This growth is mainly driven by an increased focus on reducing GHGs across America and worldwide. With any car, truck, bus, or any other vehicle capable of being manufactured to run on RNG, the shift to RNG is imminent. In the U.S, renewable energy growth is expected to accelerate in 2021 and forward as the Biden administration starts to execute many initiatives including:\n",
       "\n",
       "* Rejoining the Paris Climate Accord\n",
       "* Investing $2T into clean energy over the next 4 years\n",
       "* Fully decarbonizing the power sector by 2035 in order to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050\n",
       "\n",
       "Renewable natural gas production has already more than doubled from 2015 to 2018 growing by an annual average of 30%. If the industry continues to grow at this rate of growth, we can expect that the industry would reach 1B gallons of the annual production of RNG transportation fuel in 2022.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Final Thoughts**\n",
       "\n",
       "With CLNE being the biggest producer of RNG in the U.S and the increased demand for RNG set to accelerate as stricter restrictions come into place, we will see a shift in the transportation industry into cleaner fuel sources. The company is well-positioned in the RNG industry to continue being a leading provider and deliver attractive returns for shareholders in the future to come. Going forward, I hope to see more news on developments with bigger corporations looking to hop on the RNG wave. I think it is only soon until cities regulate the use of RNG in more commercial use transport like public transport and we see the shift to decarbonized transport\n",

       "Without further ado, let‚Äôs get to the business: the first thing to look at, is a beautiful triangular wedge formation at the core of each chart. WSB loves triangles, and this love has a fair justification. Triangles incarcerate the flattening of the price action accompanied by diminishing volatility - for the price action subsequently to make a fucking explosion, should the triangle be broken out. The perfect example of that is AMC‚Äôs price action after the breakout. \\[Juicy is what juicy does\\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc\\_looking\\_juicy\\_next\\_resistance\\_targets\\_1623/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nfaizr/amc_looking_juicy_next_resistance_targets_1623/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)), what else can I say.\n",
       "\n",
       "As you may observe, GME has a very similar triangular technical formation at its core, which has been broken out in a similar to AMC nature. Since the two stonks are short squeeze brothers in arms (...Dire Straits starts playing) and have been moving according to linear correlation for a considerable period of time, imho, it‚Äôs fair to assume that GME should catch its brother in arms up at some point in the near future, and this is the main assumption that I base my thesis on. \n",
       "\n",
       "So far so good, now take a look at those Fibo levels: the AMC retracement is applied from Jan apex (premarket 4h chart high, looks like a gap on daily) to the subsequent low during the local accumulation phase. Thereafter, the following extended Fibo levels are highlighted and are of the prior significance for the price action: 1.414, 2, 2.618, 3.272. Those same levels are used to identify the potential GME crucial resistances, and Fibo is applied accordingly.\n",

       "Another thing that supports the thesis of GME AMC-rocket-like movement is magenta highlighted patterns on MACD, which look like fucking twins on the two stonks.\n",

Just because we do our diligence and like the stock doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a fucking meme stock. I get that this is a Wendy‚Äôs, there are dumb asses, but dummies can make money too. I like the idea of buying/hold and averaging down here at this moment. It might not go back down too much at this point. \n",
       "\n",
       "RKT is up 20% over the past two weeks. There are a lot of retail investors that were ready to get out at 22 and a lot of swing traders just playing the gap fill. The thing is those shares have been getting brought up.\n",
       "\n",
       "The only reason the stock dropped as low as 16 is for two reasons: one, Gilbert transferred class D shares to class a shares for employee stock program at a 15% discount in order to increase the float and allow for more institutional ownership. This actually really helps the stock. Two, Growth funds sold the stock and now value funds are eating it up. This also includes a recent purchase from Swissbank. The stock is trading differently and shorts are having a lot harder time manipulating it due to the institutional accumulation in the Russell 1000 and additional value funds. You can check my previous DD‚Äôs for sources and more info. \n",
       "\n",
       "Right now the stock just filled the gap and hit a wall around 22.7. Institutions are letting retail buy and testing their patience. Reason why institutions do this is because they need to determine whether there are real investors or just impatient little children that cry if a stock doesn‚Äôt go up 50% in 1 hour. Once they see where we are buying they won‚Äôt allow people to accumulate very long at those levels. What happens next is called a retest at 22.7. Since Its already been doing some consolidation at those levels it will most likely break and when it does break it will go to 25. If 25 creates a lot of volume and attention there are about 45,000 contracts for June 18 at 25. 25 could be a huge wall of resistance but there could be a plan in place or this could just be a fake out before it actually takes off. \n",
       "\n",
       "I believe the floor 18.5 or 19.5 so I would look to accumulate at now, 19.5, and then load up at 18.8 with a stop loss of 16ish if you want. I believe they would initiate the buyback before it gets back below 17 simply because employees get the stock at a 15% discount and Dan transferred shares at 16.8ish so I would assume the stock stays 15% above this level. \n",
       "\n",
       "Now I wanna be very clear that this is not a fucking mortgage play. Right now that is what the market wants retail to believe. This is about a company I have previously worked for and I know firsthand that they achieve the goals set forth. They have yet to prove otherwise. Rocket homes is basically Zillow and their activity increased 300% in quarter one. Additionally rocket auto drops this August. I don‚Äôt know about you but I don‚Äôt get too thrilled going on to Carvana or Kelley blue book in order to find a car I talked to three different people before I actually get to the person that I want and then I have to find financing. Rockets mission is to make this as easy as possible so you can go onto a very clean website pick a car you want they will do the financing for you and then provide you with the vehicle. Won‚Äôt be surprised if they shipped the shit right to you eventually. Keep in mind that Detroit used to be the home of car manufacturing. Didnt Gilbert basically owns Detroit after buying up all the real estate after 2008 and has been rebuilding it since. It‚Äôs a totally different city now I have recently been there.\n",
       "\n",
       "One thing I really want to put emphasis on is the brand. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you started to see rocket homes commercials and a rocket auto commercials before September. They have also linked partnerships with golfers with big names and are using that for more marketing. As of right now they have not even started marketing these aspects but trust me it would be insane to think that they won‚Äôt make it work because if it‚Äôs one thing they know how to do it‚Äôs to market. Everyone wants the next big thing, you‚Äôll see commercials over and over again and eventually you‚Äôll actually see what rocket auto is about. When you see the platform you will hands-down choose it over any other bullshit website out there currently for cars. On top of that, they‚Äôll be the ones to provide you with the loan, they‚Äôll be the ones to profit off the sale. They don‚Äôt need a financing company like typical dealerships when you buy a car. They will fund it right to you. Competing with Zillow is a bit more of a challenge but I still think they will prevail.\n",
       "\n",
       "The company has a shitty PE ratio right now because it‚Äôs still being valued as just a mortgage company. Institutions however aren‚Äôt stupid and know this will change once the sectors start being marketed. You can see the price action right now is it institutional accumulation before they let retail pump it up.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you think that institutions would start buying a stock based off of mortgage credentials in a rising rate environment then I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôll ever be convinced. That is not what they‚Äôre doing. What I do know is that they probably believe that the amount of income they‚Äôll receive from their new revenue streams will certainly provide RKT the capital to obtain more market share in that field. Which is lucrative. \n",
       "\n",
       "Companies like Amazon wish they could get into mortgages. Except it‚Äôs very difficult field to just enter. No one knows anything about mortgages except for people who do it. Did you know that Lindsay gross gave a speech, He was Dan Gilbert‚Äôs roommate in college at law school. He actually expressed Amazon had an interest in mortgages, this is when the company was private. After looking over all of the financials and complications they decided they wouldn‚Äôt actually be able to be successful due to their business model. RKT got lucky and was at the right place at the right time. They merged technology with mortgages which is extremely profitable allowing for a constant stream of very high revenue, thus creating easier means to market additional revenue streams as they plan on doing.\n",

       "Position:  2600 shares @ 17.86 and 100 40.89s for 2023. I also have additional calls but I don‚Äôt really like giving that information out because I‚Äôm a little paranoid about hedge funds reading this shit.\n",

       "This is not advice I‚Äôm just stating the facts. If you‚Äôre looking to enter a position I believe the stock will test 25 and possibly all time highs in the next few months. I believe by 2023 it‚Äôll be over 150 a share. I would buying share until iv dies down on options.\n",

       "TLDR: rocket auto and rocket homes are soon going to be a very well-known products and institutions are starting to accumulate and take notice. This is not a mortgage play this is a value play. Don‚Äôt ever listen to any articles to justify price action that‚Äôs for the sheep. It just makes sense. All you have to do is accumulate for the next two weeks and I think you‚Äôll just see green moving forward. Below $20 a share won‚Äôt be seen after September ever again imo.\n",

If you want to invest in a mortgage and soon to be tech giant with massive growth and 194th richest company on Fortune 500 then invest in RKT. Idk about you but mortgages are boring. I like innovation. I like a company that‚Äôs ranked the fifth best place to work in the entire country. I like the company that is ranked the number one largest mortgage lender for over 10 years by JD powers. The best part is, it took three decades to get to this point so any competitor is going to have to play 30 years of catch-up at Rockets pace and trust me nobody works more than the people at RKT. 60 hours a week is a norm but execution is worshipped.\n",

       "rkt is up over the past two weeks there are a lot of retail investors that were ready to get out at and a lot of swing traders just playing the gap fill the thing is those shares have been getting brought up the only reason the stock dropped as low as is for two reasons one gilbert transferred class d shares to class a shares for employee stock program at a discount in order to increase the float and allow for more institutional ownership this actually really helps the stock two growth funds sold the stock and now value funds are eating it up this also includes a recent purchase from swissbank the stock is trading differently and shorts are having a lot harder time manipulating it due to the institutional accumulation in the russell and additional value funds you can check my previous dds for sources and more info \n",
       "right now the stock just filled the gap and hit a wall around institutions are letting retail buy and testing their patience reason why institutions do this is because they need to determine whether there are real investors or just impatient little children that cry if a stock doesnt go up in hour once they see where we are buying they wont allow people to accumulate very long at those levels what happens next is called a retest at since its already been doing some consolidation at those levels it will most likely break and when it does break it will go to if creates a lot of volume and attention there are about contracts for june at  could be a huge wall of resistance but there could be a plan in place or this could just be a fake out before it actually takes off \n",

Its products include Eversense and Eversense XL, which are implantable CGM systems to measure glucose levels in people with diabetes for a period of up to 90 and 180 days. The Eversense (90 days) has FDA approval since 2018 and the Eversense XL (180 days) is already approved in Europe and FDA approval is expected by the end of the third quarter. A CGM system provides glucose measurements regularly and gives the user an alarm when sugar levels drop too low or go too high, it can also be used in connection with an insulin pump to automatically deliver insulin when needed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Eversense technology is unique as it is a long-term CGM system that can last up to 180 days, versus 7 to 14 days from the competition, and it is the only one implantable under the skin and works with a removable transmitter (in competing products you cannot remove the transmitter; otherwise, you have to replace the whole device). It is a CGM system that allows for freedom of movement and the user can decide when to use it and all this with even better accuracy than all other CGM systems in the market.\n",
       "\n",
       "The almost demise of Senseonics in 2020 was due to some self inflicted errors and bad luck. The company tried to commercialize Eversense on its own in the USA and that consumed much of its economic resources without much success and then, when COVID hit, the company stopped commercializing Eversense as it couldn't get physicians to perform the sensor implant procedure. In March 2020, Senseonics was forced to make a $48.5 MM repayment to one of its lenders that panicked and that pushed the company into the limits of insolvency and forced it to look for a partner or outright sale.\n",
       "\n",
       "Enter Ascensia Diabetes\n",
       "\n",
       "On August 10th, 2020, the company announced a strategic collaboration with Ascensia Diabetes Care. This is a transformational alliance for Senseonics, as Ascensia is a dedicated diabetes company with a presence in 125 countries and 10 MM customers. It has the trust and reliability of being in this business for over 70 years. Ascensia is the market leader in the Blood Glucose Monitoring (BGM) market with its COUNTOUR portfolio of devices and it is the combination of several important companies with interests in the Diabetes market. Ascensia is based in Switzerland and it was established in 2016 through the acquisition of Bayer Diabetes Care by PHC Holdings (formerly known as Panasonic Healthcare Holdings), which is a KKR portfolio company.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ascensia Diabetes Care is betting big on Senseonics. Not only are they providing 35 MM in convertible debt financing but will also invest an approximate $250 MM over the next five years to commercialize and market Eversense in exclusivity all over the world. So why would such a company with approximately $1 Billion in annual sales is interested in a $4 MM revenue company?\n",
       "\n",
       "I believe Ascensia recognizes the enormous potential of this technology, which could eventually make redundant even their current business. Ascensia business is CONTOUR, a razor/razor blade business model in which the company sells blood glucose measuring devices for a low price and makes money selling the small lancets that are replaceable. Make a tour through Amazon or simply Google \"Blood glucose monitoring\" and you will find that this market is over saturated with dozens of suppliers competing in price. Ascensia prices its wares at a premium over competitors but the technology is mature so I am not so sure if new diabetes clients will be choosing Contour going forward. Basically, they need a new product that can reinvigorate the brand and put them once again at the leading edge of the diabetes market.\n",
       "\n",
       "Currently the Senseonics Eversense device requires calibration twice a day, that could be done using a Contour device to measure the glucose level and input the result in the Eversense device via an iPhone or Android Phone. But as the following slide shows, the company has a product pipeline with next generation devices that will require increasingly less calibration. The Eversense XL submitted for approval to the FDA requires only one calibration a day and the Eversense 365 will require only one rebalancing a week reducing considerably the use of lancets for blood monitoring systems.\n",
       "\n",
       "The technology has huge potential to disrupt the current CGM market, which is a $5-plus billion market today growing at about a 35% CAGR (according to SENS management) and dominated by three large companies: DexCom (DXCM), Abbott Labs (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT). This market is exclusively focused on the Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients which are intensively managed, that means they need insulin shots and many even use insulin pumps as they cannot produce any insulin themselves. The number of people with diagnosed diabetes in the USA in 2020 was 34.2 of which 1.6 MM have Type I Diabetes, unfortunately the number of people with Diabetes is growing very rapidly as can be seen from this National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2020.\n",
       "\n",
       "With FDA approval for the Eversense XL expected by the end of the third quarter, Senseonics will start to eat at the market share of the incumbent companies in the industry, but the real game changer will come with the Eversense 365, as it will open up the Type II market to this new type of CGM devices. Here the opportunity is really huge and they face no competition and none is expected anytime soon either.\n",
       "\n",
       "Currently, people with Type II diabetes have only BGM devices like CONTOUR to help them monitor their blood levels, but that requires pricking a finger to get blood and only provides a measurement at that particular moment. The 365 device will require only a 5 minute intervention every year to remove and replace the sensor and if the company gets to the point that won't need a transmitter, as you scan your smartphone over the sensor, then I believe the sky is the limit for Senseonics as there are 420 MM people with diabetes in the world.\n",
       "\n",
       "The company is providing the current guidance as to future revenues, I believe these numbers to be conservative once the Eversense XL gets approval in the USA. I am confident it will be approved, it has already been approved in Europe and the 90 days device was unanimously approved in 2018 by the FDA's Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices Panel of independent medical experts that voted, 8 to 0, that the system not only was safe and effective, but also that its benefits outweighed the risks.\n",
       "\n",
       "Senseonics is a high risk/high reward type of investment, but the type of risk I like, basically there is a small chance that the company will file for insolvency anytime soon and with the Ascencia alliance it stands a very good shot at disrupting the diabetes market. In my opinion, Senseonics has the makings of a potential multi-bagger from here and aggressive investors would be advised to initiate a position at the current levels.

       "with fda approval for the eversense xl expected by the end of the third quarter senseonics will start to eat at the market share of the incumbent companies in the industry but the real game changer will come with the eversense as it will open up the type ii market to this new type of cgm devices here the opportunity is really huge and they face no competition and none is expected anytime soon either currently people with type ii diabetes have only bgm devices like contour to help them monitor their blood levels but that requires pricking a finger to get blood and only provides a measurement at that particular moment the device will require only a minute intervention every year to remove and replace the sensor and if the company gets to the point that wont need a transmitter as you scan your smartphone over the sensor then i believe the sky is the limit for senseonics as there are mm people with diabetes in the world the company is providing the current guidance as to future revenues i believe these numbers to be conservative once the eversense xl gets approval in the usa i am confident it will be approved it has already been approved in europe and the days device was unanimously approved in by the fdas clinical chemistry and clinical toxicology devices panel of independent medical experts that voted to that the system not only was safe and effective but also that its benefits outweighed the risks senseonics is a high riskhigh reward type of investment but the type of risk i like basically there is a small chance that the company will file for insolvency anytime soon and with the ascencia alliance it stands a very good shot at disrupting the diabetes market in my opinion senseonics has the makings of a potential multibagger from here and aggressive investors would be advised to initiate a position at the current levels next catalysts for the company will be information of progress in the commercialization in europe and from april in the usa then it will be the eversense xl approval by the end of september</td>\n",

       "Company Overview\n",
       "\n",
       "**Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ:** [**CLNE**](https://utradea.com/stocks/CLNE)) provides natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicle fleets and relating fueling solutions primarily in the United States and Canada. The company supplies renewable natural gas (RNG), compressed natural gas (CNG), and liquified natural gas (LNG) for light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles. They serve heavy-duty trucking, airports, public transit, industrial, and institutional energy users as well as government fleets. With over 20 years in the alternative fuels industry, they are one of the largest (if not largest) U.S providers of FNG for commercial transportation and have a unique position in the market because of their valuable Environmental Credits.\n",
       "\n",
       "RNG which is delivered as either CNG or LNG is created by the recovery and processing of naturally occurring, environmentally detrimental waste methane from non-fossil fuel sources such as dairy farms and agriculture facilities. Methane is one of the most potent climate-harming greenhouse gases with a big impact on global warming, 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. They are focused on developing, owning, and operating dairy and other livestock waste RNG projects and supplying RNG to their customers in the commercial transportation sector.\n",
       "\n",
       "2020 Financial Results\n",
       "\n",
       "**Revenue:** CLNE‚Äôs 2020 total revenue was $209.2M which had a YoY change from 2019 of -15.2% or a decrease of $52.3M. This decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related sales but partially offset by customer contracts with their Zero Now truck financing program and an increase in station construction sales. Of the total revenue in 2020, 84.1% was from volume-related revenue mostly from fuel sales and the performance of O&amp;M services. Despite 2020‚Äôs bad financial performance attributable to economic conditions, we also saw similar companies in the industry posting decreased revenues. CLNE is positioned for high revenues with the upcoming ventures and new developments that will allow the company to expand and meet the growing demand in the transportation sector.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Expenses:** Total cost of sales accounted for 63.5% of total revenue; 55.4% from product cost of sales and 8.1% from service cost of sales. The total cost of sales decreased by 12.6% or $26.7M YoY primarily due to decreased gallons delivered during 2020 and their lower effective cost per gallon. The total operating expenses also decreased but attributable to decreased revenues. In the prior year (2018 to 2019), we saw decreased operating expenses and increased operating margin which was due to cost reduction efforts. Going forward if CLNE is able to continue decreasing their operating expenses and keep at a positive operating margin then they‚Äôll be able to post a profitable period in the upcoming years that‚Äôll help with seeing shareholder returns.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Debt:** CLNE has a short-term debt of $3.59M and long-term debt of $82.09M of totalling $85.68M making up 44.6% of their total liabilities. They have a debt ratio of 0.27 which is relatively low compared to the competitors identified that have an average of 0.68; representing CLNE‚Äôs lower debt to assets. Despite the capital-intensive industry CLNE is operating in, their lower ratio is primarily attributed to their high cash position. The lower ratio also gives insight into the company‚Äôs ability to pay off their future debts and their lower risk for bankruptcy (\n",
       "\n",
       "Recent Developments\n",
       "\n",
       "**Amazon:** It was announced in April this year that CLNE signed an agreement with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon RNG. The fuel will be provided at 27 existing CLNE fuelling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations that expects to be constructed by the end of the year. This agreement was announced after Amazon‚Äôs action earlier this year to reduce the carbon footprint of their delivery fleets.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Bp Joint Venture:** A joint venture was finalized in March this year with BP Products North America Inc. to develop, own and operate new RNG projects at dairies and other agriculture facilities. This joint venture is valued at upwards of $400M with BP investing a total of $50M. ¬†This joint venture will help to RNG production and meet the growing demand.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Chevron Adopt-a-Port:** Chevron U.S.A a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron Corp is investing a total of $28M into this initiative that focuses on providing truck operators near ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach with cleaner, carbon-negative RNG in order to reduce GHG emissions. Chevron‚Äôs funding will allow truck operators to subsidize the cost of buying new or converting RNG-powered trucks.\n",
       "\n",
       "Investment Thesis: Growing Demand for RNG\n",
       "\n",
       "The demand for RNG produced from biogas is significantly growing due to federal, state and local regulatory authorities on reducing the emission of GHG such as methane. Over the past decade, the transportation sector has been the fastest-growing end-market for RNG where it‚Äôs used as a replacement for fossil-based fuel. This growth is mainly driven by an increased focus on reducing GHGs across America and worldwide. With any car, truck, bus, or any other vehicle capable of being manufactured to run on RNG, the shift to RNG is imminent. In the U.S, renewable energy growth is expected to accelerate in 2021 and forward as the Biden administration starts to execute many initiatives including:\n",
       "\n",
       "* Rejoining the Paris Climate Accord\n",
       "* Investing $2T into clean energy over the next 4 years\n",
       "* Fully decarbonizing the power sector by 2035 in order to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050\n",
       "\n",
       "Renewable natural gas production has already more than doubled from 2015 to 2018 growing by an annual average of 30%. If the industry continues to grow at this rate of growth, we can expect that the industry would reach 1B gallons of the annual production of RNG transportation fuel in 2022.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Final Thoughts**\n",
       "\n",
       "With CLNE being the biggest producer of RNG in the U.S and the increased demand for RNG set to accelerate as stricter restrictions come into place, we will see a shift in the transportation industry into cleaner fuel sources. The company is well-positioned in the RNG industry to continue being a leading provider and deliver attractive returns for shareholders in the future to come. Going forward, I hope to see more news on developments with bigger corporations looking to hop on the RNG wave. I think it is only soon until cities regulate the use of RNG in more commercial use transport like public transport and we see the shift to decarbonized transport\n",
